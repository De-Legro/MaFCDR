Might & Fealty
==============

This is the source code for the game [Might & Fealty](http://mightandfealty.com).

![Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)

The code is provided under the [**CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), the full legal text is in the file LICENSE.
In short, this license permits you to modify and re-distribute the code, with two limitations. First, you must include a reference, at least by name, to Might & Fealty and to Tom Vogt as the original creator. Secondly, you are not allowed to use the code or any derivatives commercially.

While the license does not forbid it, mostly in order to make sure the game will always be available to the world in one form or the other, it is **strongly discouraged** to fork the game and set up a seperate game server. The game strongly depends on a critical mass of players, and splitting the player base among competing servers would most likely result in two servers failing to generate enough dynamics.


Documentation
-------------

At this time, there is no documentation except what you find inline in the code. Hopefully, the community will create some documentation in the future.


Completeness
------------

The repository is **not** a complete standalone copy of the game. While it contains all the code, the game world data is missing. There is old code in the repository that was **not** actually used to create the game world. To create a game world, you need additional scripts and manual work in something like QuantumGIS.
