General Style
-------------

* Render in Unity or Cinema 4D

* set rendered layer on top and to 50-60% opacity
* flatten image


Building Images
---------------

* load both images, set rendered on top, 60% opacity
* load _mask.psd
* use it as a mask (⌘-click) to cut out outside form both layers (make lower one non-background by double-clicking)
* add a layer style of stroke, 75% opacity to mask, set fill to 0
* merge layers, resize to 400x400 before saving as .png
