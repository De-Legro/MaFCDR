pack

solo
: tends to appear in smaller groups
indiv
: tends to appear on it's own
swarm
: represents not one monster, but many small ones (group size is always 1)
fly
: this monster is capable of flight
hover
: this monster hovers over the ground
phantom
: this monster can pass through solid objects
handler
: this monster tends to control other monsters
boss
: this is a monster that will (once implemented) cause the dungeon to close after it's killed, which will allow quests to tie in to the dungeon system.
slime
: slimes are interesting in that they float, don't float, go through things, don't go through things, can jump, but don't always splat. Eventually, we're going to code these lil' fun bunches into splitting. Whee!
