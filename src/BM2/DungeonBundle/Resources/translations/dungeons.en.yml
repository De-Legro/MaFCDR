 intro: >
   You have come upon a dungeon, a dangerous place of adventure and treasure. Higher nobility avoids these dirty holes,
   and mortals are afraid of them, but young or desperate First Ones seek them for the experience and treasures they
   contain.<br />
   For sheer survival, you can join other First Ones and enter this dungeon together, fighting your way into its depths
   until you beat it or it beats you. Teamwork is key.

areaintro:
 cave: >
   This place is a natural cave, filled mostly with wild animals. Still, there can be treasures here, mostly from
   the corpses of people killed for food by the creatures inside, or from those who ventured into the caves before,
   and failed.
 wild: >
   This is an area of untamed wilderness, where you will find animals and strange creatures of nature. There are often
   treasures once belonging to travellers lost, or shiny things gathered by the inhabitants of these unexplored reaches.
 ruin: >
   Ancient ruins whose purpose is hard to guess at. Maybe it was a castle once, or a temple. There may still be valuables
   inside, either ancient treasures or belongings of those who tried to take them and died trying. For there is no saying
   what kind of creatures you may find inside.
 dungeon: > 
   An entrance guides you down. It is impossible to guess why someone would build an underground lair at a place like this,
   nor what it was for. You are certain that treasures are hidden inside, just as you are sure that they are well guarded.

monsterdesc:
 arachnid: >
   These are not your typical household spiders, these are monsters. The small ones are as big as a cat, the large ones
   rival a wolf, and all of them have a thick exosceleton, fangs, spider webs and everything else that ensures you will
   have nightmares about them long after you have escaped. If you escape.
 bandit: >
   Human outlaws hiding from a world that wants to see them hanging. They can have a variety of weapons and armor and
   can be dangerous enemies as they know the territory and consider it their home. Especially in larger groups, they can
   be quite dangerous.
 bandita: >
   Human outlaws hiding from a world that wants to see them hanging. These bandit archers sport a variety of ranged weapons
   as well as some secondary weapons and light armor for melee combat. They can be dangerous enemies as they know the 
   territory and consider it their home. Especially in larger groups, they can be quite dangerous.
 banditb: >
   Human outlaws hiding from a world that wants to see them hanging. These outlaw leaders add experience and better equipment
   to the mix, making them quite formidable opponents. Since they know the territory and consider it their home, you should
   expect dirty fighting and trickery.
 barghest: >
   At first glance, the barghest looks like a large, dirty wolf. But if you get closer, you understand he is nothing like a
   wolf. These creatures are hunters of beasts twice their size, their teeth are like daggers and their hide is thick. They
   are covered in scars and legendary for being able to take a full sword blow and yet remain standing.
 bat: >
   Dire bats are more than just large bats, they also have fangs the size of small knives and they are not only unafraid of
   humans, they seem to enjoy human blood as a meal. Attacking from the air, they can be quite difficult to hit.
 bear: >
   Taller than a human, much stronger and easily angered, bears are not to be underestimated. They may be a bit slow,
   and prefer to live alone, but their strength is legendary and they can be quite brutal.
 beetle: >
   A swarm of fire beetles, each one the size of a mouse and with a poisonous bite that makes wounds feel as if they burn.
   These creatures can cause a surprising amount of pain for their small size, and you never meet just one.
 cat: >
   Tiger, leopard, lion, panther, lynx - who can spot the difference? These cats are big, agile and dangerous. They are faster
   than many other animals and they are predators that combine stealth and speed into a package that should not be
   taken lightly.
 crazy: >
   Something has driven this man insane, and he is not to be argued with. He will attack on sight with whatever he can find,
   sticks, stones or bare hands. Best to put him out of his misery.
 eagle: >
   These giant eagles can grow to a surprising size, and hunt sheep, deer or even cows for food. They can be quite a match
   even for a well-armed First One, especially if encountered in groups. When they swoop down on you, take cover.
 lost: >
   A lost hero of old times, this elite warrior has been mentally damaged by all the carnage he has seen and caused. He has
   retreated to this hiding place, maybe he even fought here one time, and has lost himself in a world of his own. He will
   attack any intruders, and cannot be reasoned with anymore. He is an experienced and dangerous enemy.
 ogre: >
   Nobody knows what these creatures truly are. While they look like huge, ugly humans, they show no sign of human intelligence
   and the usage of clubs is the only sign that they may be smarter than most animals. They avoid humans, but if cornered
   they are ruthless fighters, and can take an enormous amount of damage before they fall.
 snake: >
   Some are small, some weigh more than a human and are several metres long. Many are poisonous, making them even more
   dangerous. Snakes love damp, dark places and can be a nasty surprise for anyone not expecting them.
 troglodyte: >
   One of the strangest creatures of the wild, a troglodyte looks like an unholy crossbreed between a human and a lizard. They
   have a basic humanoid shape, but ash-grey reptilian skin, a salamander head and a lizard tail. They do not appear to possess
   more than basic intelligence, not do they communicate with more than grunts. As enemies, they are very dangerous as they can
   attack with claws and bites at the same time, and sometimes make use of clubs or other primitive weapons.
 wolf: >
   Wild canines that are excellent pack-hunters and highly territorial. As much as one wolf is not very dangerous for
   anyone with a sword and armor, a pack of wolves is bad news even for the well-equipped.
 wolfb: >
   Dire wolves are more than just bigger wolves, they are also incredibly aggressive and much tougher. Their thick skin
   is used as leather armor by some tribes, provided you can actually slay such a beast.
 wyvern: >
   Often mistaken for dragons, the wyvern looks much like a bat with a longer neck and lizard snout from up close. Not that
   you want to get close, as these flying reptile monsters are incredibly dangerous and their sharp talons can cut through
   even metal armor. In the air, they are agile and fast, though on the ground less so. But even wounded and downed, they
   are some of the most dangerous creatures of the wilderness.
