FORMAT (latest thing first)
  YYYYMMDD
  : Changes

20160623
: Added 3 new dungeon types: Flooded Village, Mausoleum, Ship Graveyard
: Added 1 new card: Slay Slime; for my first stab at cards, and a conditional, multi-result one at that, it's a good start.
: Implemented monster class: Slime
: Tweaked slimes and dragons a little.
: Modified dungeon closing code to accomondate varying party sizes equally. Min: 3, Max: 15, Avg: 9
: Added dungeon images. Mostly placeholds until we get something better.

20160620
: Added Mortal Dungeoneer and Monster Hunter

20160617
: Added monsters: Dragon, Guard Dog, Bandit Guard, a slew of soldiers, First Ones (special, super rare dungeon), hawks, falcons, villagers, slimes, shamans, chimeras, rats
: Added/implemented dungeon: First One Fortress
: Laid groundwork for future monster types, attack classes, and movement system, no idea when any of that will get added, but its best to assume it'll happen now than have to redo it all later.
:: Added classes: mechanoid, spirit, mixed, hover, phantom, swim, handler, indiv, mounted, slime

20160614
: Implemented dungeon types: Labyrinth, Citadel, Glade, Hold

20160603
: Adjusted party system to accomodate more/fewer dungeoneers. Min 1, Max 30. Depth system adjusted to accomodate, but it may need playtesting to truly refine it. I'm of the "let the players try it and find out" mind on that.
: Adjusted action system to require more dungeoneers to submit actions before quickening the timer. I'm not certain on the math on how this works though.
