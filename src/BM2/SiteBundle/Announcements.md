### New Server ###
If you're seeing this, congrats, you're viewing the M&F Live Test Server, codenamed "Valengard".

### Reporting Bugs ###
Please report all bugs <a href="http://forum.mightandfealty.com/index.php/topic,6026.0.html">here!</a>

### New Features ###
* You can now restore inactive Subrealms!
* Realm info can be viewed without being logged in
* Link to wiki exists
* You can now exit a settlement

### New Fixes ###
* Bandits won't be quite as numermous anymore (once we get some turns going anyways).
* Slumbering FO's no longer grant experience
* Most forms know how to close themselves (that means there shouldn't be any extra '>' floating about.) If you find one, report it!
* Most tables are now sortable
* Dungeons now know what languages they can speak
* Dungeons no longer present framework errors
* You can no longer view economic security at a distance (unless you're the lord)
* You can now link to Publications and Positions in messages. Linking to "items" no longer breaks the game.
* Realm elections will trigger for absent rulers

### System Updates ###
* MarkDown Syntax and Twig versions have been updated to modernity

### Current Build ###
M&F Version 1.0.1.2 - "Community Takeover Build"
Pending Work: Fixing or Shelving Lendan Towers (these are responsible for a number of errors).
