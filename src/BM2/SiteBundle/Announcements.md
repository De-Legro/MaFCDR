### New Server ###
If you're seeing this, it looks like you've successfully found the new Might & Fealty server!

### New Features ###
* Heraldry is now shared between partnerships (as appropriate) and by parent(s) to children. **Heraldry is no longer account specific.**
* You can now restore inactive Subrealms!
* Realm info can be viewed without being logged in
* Link to wiki exists
* You can now exit a settlement

### New Fixes ###
* A tool exists for the banishment of cheaters.
* The game is smart enough to know what server it's running on.
* Non-functional BitPay functionality has been removed.
* Library maps are now generating properly.
* Map loadlist no longer appears on realm pages, which will improve page usability for smaller displays.
* Lendan Towers & the new Communication systems have been removed until they can be completed. 
* As such, battles should now be startable.
* Bandits won't be quite as numermous anymore (once we get some turns going anyways).
* Slumbering FO's no longer grant experience
* Most forms know how to close themselves (that means there shouldn't be any extra '>' floating about.) If you find one, report it!
* Most tables are now sortable
* Dungeons now know what languages they can speak
* Dungeons no longer present framework errors
* You can no longer view economic security at a distance (unless you're the lord)
* You can now link to Publications and Positions in messages. Linking to "items" no longer breaks the game.
* Realm elections will trigger for absent rulers

### System Updates ###
* MarkDown Syntax and Twig versions have been updated to modernity

### Current Build ###
M&F Version 1.0.2.5 - "Community Takeover Build"
Pending Work: Abandoning settlements, and probably seneschals.
