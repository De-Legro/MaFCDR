The world of Might & Fealty being as political as it is, messages play a very important part. Fortunately, First Ones are not as limited as mortal humans are when it comes to exchanging messages, and it will not take three weeks for a letter to cross an empire.

The lynchpin of communications are the Lendan towers. With a large magical stone raised above the roofs of the settlement, they can receive and broadcast messages from the smaller Lendan stones that First Ones carry around with them. If you have not yet read the fiction section: These magical stones allow communication over big distances, and messages sent through them can be magically sealed to be readable only by specific recipients.

The magical process that allows the sealing of messages also provides a kind of magical signature or authentication, making the forging of messages sent through Lendan stones impossible. At the same time, it also prevents the owner of the Lendan tower from interfering with messages. He can tear the tower down, but he cannot filter messages.



Receiving Messages
------------------
All First Ones automatically receive all messages sent through all Lendan towers in range. The sending range of towers is higher than the receiving range, so you can receive messages that you cannot reply to without getting closer. Your location at the time the message is sent decides if you receive a message or not, so it does not matter when you read your messages.

Many messages that you receive will be magically sealed for others, and you cannot read them. Anyway you will know that there was a message, and your scribes will give you a summary of received, unreadable messages in addition to your own messages. This information can actually be useful, to have an estimate of local messaging activity, especially when it changes suddenly which is often an indicator that something is going on.


Archiving Messages
------------------
The magical stone also stores messages that it received, but only for a limited time. But you can **archive** messages, if you have a scribe. He will copy it to paper and keep it for you as long as you want.


Sending Messages
----------------
You can send messages at any time to any Lendan tower in range. This range is smaller than the range of towers sending messages around, but it is still several miles and you will usually have several towers that you can send to.

When sending a message, you decide if you want to seal it for one particular character, for a group (see below) or for all members of a realm. Only these recipients will then be able to read it. However, group and realm changes also affect readability of messages, so if you join a group/realm, all previously received messages sealed for that group/realm become readable to you. If you leave a group/realm, you lose access to all those messages, except for archived messages.


Broadcasting Messages
---------------------
Lendan towers can also send messages to each other. By marking a message as a **broadcast** for a specific realm, the tower you send it to will also connect to all other towers in range, and if they belong to that realm as well, send it to those, and they will propagate it.
This way, you can effectively send messages to everywhere in your realm, plus some distance across the borders. It allows entire realms to communicate with each other, but also to make announcements to everyone within the realm area.

Note that the message will propagate from tower to tower. A realm with several disconnected land areas or with too few Lendan towers in its settlements could result in a message broadcast in one part of the realm not reaching another part. The people working at the Lendan tower can visualise the area reached with a broadcast message for you. If you are in the field, one helpful rule-of-thumb is that any Lendan towers that you can reach (i.e. send to) can also connect to each other, so there is no advantage in sending the same message to different towers.


Linked Stones
-------------
One additional very important option is that you can enter a Lendan tower and *link* one of your personal stones to the tower stone. This takes a short time after which the stones are synchronised on a magical level and can communicate with each other over very large distances.
This is most useful for keeping a link to your lords esatate, or to one or more of your own estates while you travel abroad, or to the realm capital. But of course you can also use it to attend a tournament and stay in touch while you travel on, or to build a network of important diplomatic contacts that you can always message.

The most important thing about linking stones is that you have only a very limited number of them, so you cannot maintain as many links as you probably want. You will have to make tough decisions about which links to keep and which to sacrifice.


Message Tags
------------
So far, all messages are just one unstructured endless chatter. To bring order to chaos, you can use **message tags**. You can use anything you like as a tag, usually you will want to use a short word.

Tags allow filtering. You can use them to simply create conversations with names so you know which messages belong together. Or you can use them as keywords for topics. You can mix these and other purposes as you like.

To make the best out of the message system, realms will want to create their own ontology, basically a list of tags with defined meanings and some rules for using them. Well organised realms will have more effective communication.


Message Groups
--------------
Sometimes, you want to keep in touch with a specific group of people. Maybe as a ruler you want an advisory council, or you have a dungeon exploration group, or you are planning a rebellion. That is why you can create a **message group**. 

Message groups need to be created in a Lendan tower. The process of creating a group uses up some very precious gems and other materials, but the people operating the tower will procure those for you and simply charge you 100 gold for their trouble. And yes, even as the settlement owner you have to pay that, those gems aren't grown locally.

Once you have a message group, you can add other people to it, and seal messages to all the members of the group. You can add other people as *owners* and/or as *members*. Owners can manage the group, adding and removing other members. Members can send and receive messages. Usually, owners will also be members, but you can also have non-member owners (who can manage the group, but don't receive messages) for example if a ruler sets up a message group for his realm that he doesn't want to participate in, but keep control over membership.

Message groups can also be **open**. An open group can be joined by anyone who goes to one of the towers linked to the group. To link a tower to a group, you simply have to go to the tower, be an owner of the group, and again use up a few magical gems and such, this time for only 10 gold.
