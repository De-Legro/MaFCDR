Both for our internal testing and to make it easier to reproduce any problems, there is a publicly accessible test instance.

The test instance is entirely seperated from the live game, no data from the actual game is available in the test. It does share the map, but contains only a very small part of it (two islands in the south-west).

To access the test instance, follow this link and check that it says *"environment: test"* in the footer.

   Both Carol and David use the family crest.


Test Reset
----------
The test instance will automatically reset twice a day, at midnight and noon local server time.
It can also be manually reset by an administrator.

So don't count on any changes you make to persist. If you are trying to reproduce a problem, always note all the steps towards as well.



Turns
-----
The test instance does not, at this time, run any turns. However, it is planned to change that later, or make running of turns available through some button.
